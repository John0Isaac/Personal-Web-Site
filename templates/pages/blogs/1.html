                        <h2>How did I know about the program?</h2>
                        <p>
                          One day I was going to my lecture and I met some people in our open area and they told me about a program that is provided by Google for students 
                          and guess what?<br><strong>I DID NOT BELIEVE THEM.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later that day when I got back home I googled what they claimed and it was TRUE. <br>
                            <br>
                            <iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DcN_hcHXR_0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </p>
                        <h2>Applying for the program & Getting Rejected</h2>
                        <p>
                          I told my friend right away and we applied together really early as soon as the application was open. => <a href="https://goo.gle/gdsc-leads" class="text-accent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">goo.gle/gdsc-leads</a>
                          <br>
                          We got the response together.. She got accepted and I got rejected.<br>
                          <em>This really made me sad.</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I questioned myself days and nights, what did I do wrong? Is there is anything that I could've done better? and finally, I decided to contact our Project Manager <a class="text-accent" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iayazedan/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Aya Sayed</a>.
                          She didn't reply lol but she saw my message. later on, she told that this message was one of the reasons I was accepted.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And to my surprise, the reason I got rejected was that I was <em>too spontaneous</em> I never knew there was such a thing but there is, and that it is very important
                          to think before you speak. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Working with my Core Team</h2>
                        <p>
                            After being select as the GDSC Lead 2020-2021 I started forming my core team I searched for the following qualities Fun, Friendly, Passionate, Helpful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And I found them my dearest core team members. we worked together in the first couple of months on learning about Google Technologies and Qwiklabs.<br>
                            we spent a lot of nights together solving quests and labs. <em>It was sooo fun.</em> 
                        <p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            It really was a life-changing experience for me learning about a lot of new things that I never heard of like all the Google Technologies lol and Communities.
